EnchantMore - enchanted hoes, enchanted fishing rods, enchanted shears and more!

Ever wanted enchanted flint & steel? Or enchanted hoes, shears, fishing rods,
or new enchantment effects on axes, bows, and other tools? EnchantMore adds
dozens of new effects, ranging from entertainingly destructive to legitimately useful.

## Features
* 36 new item/enchantment effects
* Items in inventory appear as expected (glowing + descriptive tooltip), no client mods required - [screenshot](http://imgur.com/BNqBi)
* Only adds functionality, does not change any â€“ all your existing enchanted tools work as expected

**Important**: to enchant items, you currently need to use an inventory editor or enchanting plugin,
such as [Tim The Enchanter](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchanter/). New enchantments are *not* yet 
accessible through enchanting tables. Consider this a feature, as it allows access to the special
items to be tightly controlled.
