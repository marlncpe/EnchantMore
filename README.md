EnchantMore - enchanted hoes, enchanted fishing rods, enchanted shears and more!

Ever wanted enchanted flint & steel? Or enchanted hoes, shears, fishing rods,
or new enchantment effects on axes, bows, and other tools? EnchantMore adds
dozens of new effects, ranging from entertainingly destructive to legitimately useful.

## Features
* New enchantment/item combinations
* Items in inventory appear as expected (glowing + descriptive tooltip), no client mods required - [screenshot](http://imgur.com/BNqBi)
* Only adds functionality, does not change any -- all your existing enchanted tools work as expected

**Important**: to enchant items, you currently need to use an inventory editor or enchanting plugin,
such as [Tim The Enchanter](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/enchanter/). New enchantments are *not* yet 
accessible through enchanting tables. Consider this a feature, as it allows access to the special
items to be tightly controlled.


### Available Effects

(add from list.sh)

## Limitations
* Not all enchantments reasonably combine with one another

* Some effects are overpowered; be careful!
